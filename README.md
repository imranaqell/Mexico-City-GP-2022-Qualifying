# Verstappen On Pole In The 2022 Mexican Grand Prix 

**Introduction**

The weekend looks so entertaining as three of the top teams are set to challenge for pole position. Higher altitudes in Mexico mean that even with the dominant straight line speed of the Red Bull, they could as well be matched by other teams. Mercedes were set to be on pole after the free practice 3 session as they dominated it by quite a significant margin. 

In Q2, the top three teams' gap to each other was so close that it got most fans up on their seats and their hearts racing. In Q3, Hamilton accidentally crossed the track limits on the first run, which cost him a decent lap time. He did improve on the second run, but it was not enough to beat Max Verstappen's lap time. Meanwhile, George Russell was improving his lap time, especially in the middle sector, where he set a purple sector, which was very strong. Unfortunately, he exceeded the track limits, which cost him the whole lap to be deleted. Tweaks made on the Red Bull rear wing on the last run in Q3 were definitely crucial as Max Verstappen was able to benefit quite significantly from them.
